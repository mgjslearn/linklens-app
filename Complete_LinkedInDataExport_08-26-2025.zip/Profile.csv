Mahathi,Gumudavelli,,,Dec 13,"CS at Georgia Tech | Former Intern @ GE Vernova, Federal Reserve, Statefarm, Cisco, DataSeers","I am a CS major with concentrations in intelligence and cybersecurity at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am seeking to find a tech-based internship/research study/project. Interested in learning/working in Software Development(SWE), AI/ML/Data Engineering, Product Management, and UI/UX.  This is a link to my self-coded portfolio:  Tech portfolio: https://mgjslearn.github.io/mahathigumudavelli_portfolio/, Art portfolio: mgjslearn.github.io/portfoliomg/  Growing up and seeing tech clubs with discouragingly low number of female participants, drove me to  educate and bring more women into technology-oriented majors. With this goal, I started the ATL chapter of ProjectCSGirls and founded the GIT (Girls In Technology) Bridge the Gap club at my high school to educate young girls in the Metro Atlanta area about the diversity of this field. Along with furthering my passion in computing and technology, I hope to create change and aim to close the present gender gap.  I hope to gain more knowledge about this major by participating in new projects, studies, or internships, along with furthering my goal to close the gender gap in tech-based majors, so that this field is not deprived of any possible talents in the future.",Software Development,30097,Atlanta Metropolitan Area,,"[PORTFOLIO:https://mahathig-personal-website.vercel.app/,OTHER:http://projectcsgirlsatl.weebly.com,PORTFOLIO:https://user-krqy74iq.vsble.me]",
