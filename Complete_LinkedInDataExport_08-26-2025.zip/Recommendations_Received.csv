Shawn,Gorrell,Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta,"Director, Innovation and Agility","My team and I had the privilege of mentoring Mahathi during our summer 2024 internship program at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.   Mahathi has a positive attitude and works well within a team, with a strong focus on delivering customer outcomes. My favorite thing about Mahathi is her level of intellectual curiosity and passion for learning. She has a knack for asking great questions.   She stepped outside her comfort zone to deliver a Pecha Kucha presentation to a large audience and did multiple project demos to business area sponsors and IT leaders.  Mahathi is an agile learner and leaned into everything we needed her to learn. Over the summer, she gained skills in Microsoft Power Platform, Power BI, and SharePoint Online to develop applications to automate complex business processes to support key Bank initiatives.   Mahathi would be a valued team member for roles that require collaboration and teamwork, presentation skills, and application/business intelligence development.","12/27/24, 05:22 PM",VISIBLE
